Well not much to say here, I'm just a student who enjoys technology. I started messing around with computers and programming when I was younger, but did stop for awhile. About a year ago, I started developing again mainly to satisfy my curiosity when learning about Viruses and Malware. Unfortunately I haven't been able to keep up with my development for a bit, but I'm going to try to get back into this semester. I also plan on doing more reverse-engineering, the NSA CodeBreaker Challenge and NCL Cyber Competitions were my first introduction to that, and I found it very enjoyable. So, yea...
